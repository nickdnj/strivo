"""Diagnosis tiers. See docs/SELF-HEALING.md.

- Tier 1 (default, implemented): deterministic rules. No AI, no key, no extra hardware.
- Tier 2 (optional, not implemented yet): a local model, e.g. on a box with enough memory, to read redacted logs
  and suggest a likely cause or a draft rules change.
- Tier 3 (optional, not implemented yet): a cloud model with the user's own key, for drafting a diagnosis or a
  report. Off by default; shows exactly what will be sent and asks first.

Whatever the tier, a model may only *propose*: it never runs code, never installs anything and never posts
anything. Input is always passed through `redact()` first.
